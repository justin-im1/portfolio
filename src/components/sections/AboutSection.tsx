        I&apos;m a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, specializing in full-stack development, driven by a passion for building impactful software solutions. I&apos;m always striving to improve and committed to continuous learning. In previous internships, I&apos;ve built a wide range of powerful features for users.

        Outside of coding, I&apos;m a die-hard Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Blue Jays fan. I also love golfing, with Torrey Pines South being my favorite course, and experimenting with new recipes from around the world.

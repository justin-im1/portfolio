        Hi 👋 I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, specializing in full-stack development, driven by a passion for building impactful software solutions. I'm always striving to improve and committed to continuous learning 🚀. In previous internships at Constant Contact, University Health Network, and Voxer, I've built a wide range of powerful features for users.

        Outside of coding, I'm a die-hard Toronto Maple Leafs 🏒 and Toronto Blue Jays ⚾️ fan. I also love golfing, with Torrey Pines South being my favourite course ⛳️, and experimenting with new recipes from around the world 🍳.

        I'm currently seeking winter 2026 internship opportunities!

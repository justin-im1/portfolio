        Hi 👋 I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, specializing in full-stack development, driven by a passion for building impactful software solutions. I'm always striving to improve and committed to continuous learning. In previous internships at Constant Contact, University Health Network, and Voxer, I've built a wide range of powerful features for users.

        Outside of coding, I'm a die-hard Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Blue Jays fan. I also love golfing, with Torrey Pines South being my favourite course, and experimenting with new recipes from around the world.

        I'm currently seeking winter 2026 SWE internship opportunities!
